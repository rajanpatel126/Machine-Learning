## EDA on Fifa World cup data

- I have used 3 different data files containing following information:

  1. Fifa ranking - world ranking of each team in football
  2. Matches - Information about all the world cup match teams, penulty, substituion, red/yellow card info
  3. Worldcups - Since the 1st edition till the last edition of worldcup; winner, top scorer, runner-up, match attendance

# I have focused in calculating the inference of the data and not focusing on the ML point of view.

- The data is ranging from 1930 to 2022.

- Point to be noted: After 2nd world war 1949, Germany DR and West Germany were the 2 parts of 'Germany'. After 1910, these parts were combined again. So, the team data column needs to be changed.
